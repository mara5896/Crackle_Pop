            <p>At the age of about 9, I had foreseen my future... My mom had worked in business her whole life, and I've always looked up to her, and that's when I started. I worked on a Lenovo Thinkpad that my mom had let me use for fun. I had been into the action sport known as "Scootering". Now it doesn't seem like and action sport but if you see the videos, you'd known why I liked it. I started making videos, by recording on an iPhone 4 in garage be doing bunny hops. It doesn't sound like much, but it was a start. I would email myself the footage and watched them on my Thinkpad. One day I got the crazy idea to put the clips into a one video and watch it like that. and that's when I explored Windows movie maker. I made more Scooter videos in the future, some turning ok, and some turning out awesome! Months later I got a book called "Python for kids" by Jason R. Briggs. I downloaded the IDE and started programming like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, I stopped half way through the book because I was bored. I relaxed from programming by creating my first business. It was called "DarkShadowScooters". From that I learned a lot. I learned how to do ecommerce and marketing (From the help of my mom) and my video editing skills sharpened, I actually got good at the sport. I downloaded Vegas Pro 14 to upgrade my video editing skills. Eventually the business died but  I explored a new passion of digital art. I used an online program called Pixlr.com . And I created my second business called "Shadow Teck". I started to make YouTube banners for people and intro giveaways. Shadow Teck quickly became a business of my talents. I would video edit,Graphic design and Social Media Marketing. I started to learn social media tactics like SEO and google vocabulary. But then something tragic happened. My laptop (I had bought my own a year before, it was a Asus X540SA) couldn't handle all the stuff I was doing with it. It only had an intel pentium processor and barley clocked a GHZ. So i crashed unexpectedly. and for 6 months. until one day as I was taking a walk, me and my neighbor engaged into a conversation about computers, long story short, about a month later it was back up in running. Thatâ€™s when I decided to bring coding back into the skill book. I bought a HTML and CSS book from barnes and noble and started coding. I also found the Python for kids book and started that as well. One thing is certain from this story i just got done explaining, and it is that this is just chapter one of my story...
